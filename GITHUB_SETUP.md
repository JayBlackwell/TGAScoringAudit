# GitHub Repository Setup

Your TGA Scoring Audit project is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Here's how to set it up:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"
   - Repository name: `TGAScoringAudit`
   - Description: `🏌️ TGA Scoring Audit - Automated Golf Genius scoring issue detection with Web GUI`
   - Make it **Public** (so your team can access it easily)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Copy the repository URL** from the quick setup page (should be something like):
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TGAScoringAudit.git
   ```

4. **Run these commands** in your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/jay/Code/ClaudeCode/TGAScoringAudit
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TGAScoringAudit.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first if needed:
# curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
# echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
# sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh

# Then authenticate and create repo:
gh auth login
gh repo create TGAScoringAudit --public --description "🏌️ TGA Scoring Audit - Automated Golf Genius scoring issue detection with Web GUI"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TGAScoringAudit.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Already Prepared
